Want to make a game site with two games

1. Blackjack game
   1. Dealer has rules, using math.random for cards etc.
   2. win is beating the dealer
      1. Need money - start with 100$ each hand is 15$
      2. Can beg for more money if under 15$
2. 3. Maybe a flappy birds type thing
3. 2. Some sort of shooter/space aliens game
   1. win state is killing all the ships

1 - building deck with loops
adding the suits

can get it to take out of the deck - need to do one to player and one to dealer.

difficult looping over in the class but worked around.

Flappy files is NOT my work just testing/exploring it.

1. Demo [5 mins]
2. Show code (1. new thing learned & Biggest challenge ) [5 mins]
3. Questions
